[Official coursebook information](http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/optimization-for-machine-learning-CS-439)

`Lectures:` Fri 13:15-15:00 in [BC01](http://plan.epfl.ch/?lang=en&room=BC01)

`Exercises:` Fri 15:15-17:00 in [BC01](http://plan.epfl.ch/?lang=en&room=BC01)

This course teaches an overview of modern optimization methods, for applications in machine learning and data science. In particular, scalability of algorithms to large datasets will be discussed in theory and in implementation.

Basic Contents:

Convexity, Gradient Methods, Proximal algorithms, Stochastic and Online Variants of mentioned methods, Coordinate Descent Methods, Subgradient Methods, Frank-Wolfe, Accelerated Methods, Primal-Dual context and certificates, Lagrange and Fenchel Duality, Second-Order Methods, Quasi-Newton Methods. Black-Box Optimization.

Advanced Contents:

Parallel and Distributed Optimization Algorithms, Synchronous and Asynchronous Communication.

Computational and Statistical Trade-Offs (Time vs Data vs Accuracy). Variance Reduced Methods, and Lower Bounds.

Non-Convex Optimization: Convergence to Critical Points, Saddle-Point methods, Alternating minimization for matrix and tensor factorizations
